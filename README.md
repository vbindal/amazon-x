# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
Starting the Backend
To start the backend services for this project, follow these steps:

1) Clone the Project: Ensure you have cloned the project repository to your local machine.
  git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git
  cd your-project

2) Navigate to the Backend Directory: Assuming your backend functions are located in a folder named functions.
  cd functions

3) Install Dependencies: Install the required dependencies for the backend functions.
   npm install
   
4) Start Firebase Emulators: Use Firebase CLI to start the emulators.
   firebase emulators:start
   This command will start the Firebase emulators, allowing you to test your backend functions locally.

5) Run the Frontend: Open a new terminal window and navigate back to the root directory of your project. Then, start the frontend application.
   cd ..
   npm start


** Your React app should now be running on http://localhost:3000 and your backend functions should be running locally using Firebase emulators. 
   You can now develop and test both frontend and backend components simultaneously.
